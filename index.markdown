While we are stuck inside "working" remotely I figured I would take the opportunity to offer my knowledge to help anyone who does any organizing that is data centric. I'll show some ways I know how to make nice statistics out of freely entered text data from Google forms, some voter file tricks, and maybe some general sequel advice.

I will put all of it on this site, preferably to supplement a virtual meeting but also for perusing at conveneince. The goal of this tutorial is going to be best to give practical advice and also like general technical training.

You can find download the necessary software to install here: [Downloads][downloads].

You can follow along with the steps I will demonstrate: [Steps][setup-steps].

I plan to include some instructions on how to accomplish useful tasks that I have optimized over time for needing to do them myself, those will be posted here: [Tutorials][tutorials]
